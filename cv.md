## About me
I'm 22 years old. I had graduated from university at 2022. My major was Software Engineering. Now I work as Service Desk Specialist in ICL company. My current job give me an oppotunity to improve my social skills and understanding how processes work in IT compampanies. Now I'm interested in Frontend developer profession. Because it combines two fields such as design and programming. I like to know that alrorithms and functions became visible and I can see a result of my work.

This field is required permanent improvement of skills. I know that it will be nessesary to read, watch and learn a lot of new information consistently.

As my final work at university I develop a clent-server web-application based on MVP pattern with connection to MongoDB. For client side I used HTML/CSS and JS, for server – node.js Also I created a simple desktop applications using Windows Forms and SQL requests to database. I have expirience of using CMS WordPress.
## Code example
Program to print all prime number from 2 to n.
```
"use strict";
let n = prompt("Enter a number:","");
let result=false;
for(let i=2; i<=n;i++){
    for(let j=2;j<i;j++){
      if(i%j==0) {
        result = false;
        break;
      }
      else{
        result = true;
      }
    }
    if(result === true){
      console.log(i);
    }
}
```
